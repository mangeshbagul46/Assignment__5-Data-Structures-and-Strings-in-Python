                                            # ASSIGNMENT 5:
                            # Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python
# Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
#
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
# 2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
# 3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
# 4.   If the student’s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

# my_dict = {"Alice":85,"mangesh":95,"vinay":35}
# user_input = input("Enter the student name:")
# if user_input in my_dict:
#     print(f"{user_input}'s marks: {my_dict[user_input]}")
# else:
#     print("student name not found")

                                # Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
# 2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
# 3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
# 4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

number = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print("Original list:", number)
first_5 = number[:5]
print("first five extracted number:", first_5)
first_5.reverse()
print("reversed number:", first_5)
# print("reversed number", number[:5][::-1])
